In this workshop, you will learn how to provision, manage, and maintain your Kubernetes 
clusters with Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS) at any scale on Spot Instances to architect for optimizations on cost and scale. 
We will dive deep using hands-on material to provision worker nodes using Amazon EKS managed node groups, scale the worker nodes, understand interruption handling, and design for fault tolerance.

This workshop is originally based on AWS [EKS Workshop](https://eksworkshop.com/). You can find 
there more modules and learn about other Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service best practices.
